        Use Of Defer 

        - When we are using script tag at inner Head with 
        defer then our HTML script runs first then JS will
        work.

        - By default async is there with script tag

        that means first run js and then look at HTML

        and if we don't want to use defer then we can write 
        our Script tag after html means before end of body tag
